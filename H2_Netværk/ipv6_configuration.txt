/////////////////////// IPV6 ///////////////////////////

1. Global IPv6 Configuration

    ipv6 unicast-routing
    Enables IPv6 routing on the router. This is a critical command for IPv6 functionality.
    ipv6 cef
    Enables Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) for IPv6, improving packet switching performance.

2. Interface Configuration

    ipv6 address <address/prefix-length> [eui-64]
    Configures a static IPv6 address on an interface. The eui-64 option automatically generates the interface ID.
    ipv6 address autoconfig [default]
    Enables Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) on the interface.
    ipv6 enable
    Enables IPv6 processing on an interface without assigning a specific address.
    ipv6 nd suppress-ra
    Suppresses the router advertisements (RAs) on an interface.
    ipv6 nd reachable-time <milliseconds>
    Sets the time a neighbor is considered reachable after a reachability confirmation.

3. Routing Protocols

    router rip <tag>
    Enters the RIPng (RIP for IPv6) routing process configuration mode.
    router eigrp <as-number>
    Enters the EIGRP for IPv6 routing process configuration mode.
    router ospfv3 <process-id>
    Enters the OSPFv3 routing process configuration mode.
    router bgp <as-number>
    Enters the BGP configuration mode for IPv6. Within this mode, you would use address-family ipv6 to configure IPv6-specific BGP settings.
    redistribute <protocol> ipv6
    Redistributes routes from one routing protocol into another for IPv6.

4. Access Control and Security

    ipv6 access-list <name>
    Creates or enters the configuration mode for an IPv6 access control list (ACL).
    permit ipv6 any any
    Allows IPv6 traffic from any source to any destination (used within an IPv6 ACL).
    deny ipv6 any any
    Blocks IPv6 traffic from any source to any destination (used within an IPv6 ACL).
    ipv6 traffic-filter <acl-name> [in | out]
    Applies an IPv6 ACL to an interface for inbound or outbound traffic.

5. Neighbor Discovery

    ipv6 nd router-preference <high | medium | low>
    Configures the preference level for the router advertisements (RAs) sent by the router.
    ipv6 nd managed-config-flag
    Configures the router to instruct hosts to use DHCPv6 for address configuration.

6. DHCPv6 Configuration

    ipv6 dhcp pool <name>
    Creates a DHCPv6 pool and enters DHCPv6 configuration mode.
    address prefix <prefix/prefix-length> lifetime <valid-lifetime> <preferred-lifetime>
    Configures the prefix and lifetimes for a DHCPv6 pool.
    dns-server <address>
    Configures a DNS server's IPv6 address in the DHCPv6 pool.
    ipv6 dhcp relay destination <address>
    Configures an interface to relay DHCPv6 requests to a DHCPv6 server.

7. Tunneling

    interface tunnel <number>
    Enters configuration mode for a tunnel interface.
    tunnel mode ipv6ip [6to4 | isatap | manually configured]
    Specifies the tunnel mode for IPv6 tunneling.
    tunnel source <interface>
    Configures the source interface or IP address for the tunnel.
    tunnel destination <address>
    Specifies the destination IPv6 address for the tunnel.

8. Multicast

    ipv6 pim sparse-mode
    Enables IPv6 Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) sparse mode on an interface.
    ipv6 mld join-group <group-address>
    Configures an interface to join a specific IPv6 multicast group.

9. Quality of Service (QoS)

    ipv6 traffic-class <value>
    Configures the traffic class field in the IPv6 header for QoS marking.
    ipv6 policy-map <name>
    Applies a QoS policy map to an interface for IPv6 traffic.
